Machine Learning Model for a User Betting Recommendation System

# Final Thoughts
## Business Objective:
The original business objective was to develop a system that delivers personalized betting recommendations to users. The system would analyze each user’s historical betting behavior and preferences. This could significantly enhance user engagement and satisfaction by tailoring the betting experience to individual preferences, much like how Netflix recommends movies and shows to its users.

## Approach Summary:
To achieve the goal of providing personalized betting recommendations, I employed a collaborative filtering approach, specifically using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) model. The project began with the collection, feature engineering, and general EDA of the data, which included features such as user IDs, bet types, amounts wagered, time spent on the app, and the outcomes of their bets.

This project implemented a personalized betting recommendation system using the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) model. The process begins by prompting the user to enter their User ID, ensuring that recommendations are tailored to each individual.

The system first identifies the bet types the user has previously interacted with, using this historical data as the foundation for the recommendations. It then maps each bet type to its associated sport, adding contextual relevance to the suggestions.

The SVD model predicts a rating for each bet type, indicating the user’s likely interest or success. These predictions are sorted, and the top-rated bet types are recommended to the user, along with their associated sports and predicted ratings.

This approach effectively combines user-specific data with contextual information to deliver personalized and relevant betting recommendations.

The trained SVD model was then evaluated using cross-validation techniques, specifically calculating RMSE and MAE to assess its accuracy. After calcualting these measures, the RSME and MAE were low ensuring that the model was performing well.

## Key Findings and Insights
The implementation of the SVD-based collaborative filtering model yielded several important insights into user behavior and the effectiveness of personalized recommendations on the platform. One of the most significant findings was the model’s ability to accurately predict user preferences for different bet types, as evidenced by the relatively low Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values across multiple cross-validation folds. These metrics indicated that the model could reliably estimate the likelihood of a user engaging with and potentially succeeding in specific betting scenarios. By aligning recommendations with both the user’s historical behavior and the specific context of the bet, the system was able to provide more tailored and relevant suggestions. This approach not only increased the accuracy of predictions but also enhanced the overall user experience by offering bet types that aligned closely with individual preferences.

By consistently providing users with bet types that they are more likely to enjoy or succeed with, the platform can encourage longer sessions, more frequent betting, and ultimately, higher lifetime value per user. These findings underscore the importance of personalization in maintaining a competitive edge in the sports betting industry.

## Future Work
While the current implementation of the SVD-based collaborative filtering model has shown promising results in predicting user preferences and enhancing engagement on the platform, there are several avenues for future work that could further improve the system's performance and impact.

One potential area for improvement is the exploration of more advanced recommendation algorithms, such as Wide & Deep Learning models or Factorization Machines. These models can integrate a wider range of features, including demographic data, time of day, and historical betting trends, to provide even more personalized and context-aware recommendations.

Additionally, the current model primarily focuses on predicting user preferences based on past interactions. To further enhance the recommendation system, future work could explore the integration of real-time data streams and dynamic user modeling. By continuously updating user profiles and preferences based on real-time interactions, the system could provide more timely and relevant recommendations, adapting to changes in user behavior and market conditions.

Lastly, A/B testing and user feedback loops could be implemented to empirically validate the effectiveness of the recommendations. By testing different versions of the recommendation algorithm with live users and gathering feedback, the system can be fine-tuned to better meet user needs and preferences.
